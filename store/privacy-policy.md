# Cron Expression Generator & Tester — Privacy Policy

**Effective:** February 5, 2026  

We built this app to work offline for cron generation and verification. The current version does not collect, store, or transmit personal data.

## Data we handle
- Cron expressions you type stay on-device.
- Upcoming run calculations are computed locally.
- No analytics, crash reporting, or ads SDKs are embedded yet. If ad networks or analytics are added later, we will update this policy and request any required consent.

## Permissions
- No special device permissions are requested.

## Children’s privacy
The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes
Updates to this policy will be posted in the app repository and store listing with a new effective date.
